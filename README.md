# The Air We Breathe
### Visualizing Air Quality in Colorado 

# We Give A Hoot

## About
This repository was built to visualize the Air Quality index across the state of Colorado.

In this project, we utilized Jupyter Notebook, Python and Pandas to make an API call from OpenWeatherMaps's air pollution API using a list of Colorado cities.  This data was cleaned in Jupyter notebook and loaded into a SQLite database. 

The team also added several visulations including a map with markers and a heatmap colored by AQI. The map also includes several layers, including a heatmap and has a tooltip when a City is selected.  Other visualations include a Air Quality Index gauge indicator and bar chart that shows pollution component concentrations. Both of these visualtions are built with an event listener to update from a selection in a drop down menu.  The remaining visulations show how many cities fall into each AQI category as well as how many people are currently living in each AQI category.  The last visualtion is a radar chart that shows pollution component percentage normalized to the lower threshold of a medium AQI rating.
